Mood & Reflections

This project was made to keep track on my thoughts and reflection throughout a specific period of time.


How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js

In this project, I wanted to write down my thought and reflections as i go about my day. I can add and remove my thoughts, still working on an edit feature.

Optimizations
Still need better styling.

Lesson Learned:
Will come later when changes are made.
